## Research Question(s) to be Answered
What impact did the variable of race have on COVID infection and death rates in Illinois? Chicago? 
Secondarily, maybe consider gender. 

In addition, utilize Chicago city government COVID data to do a similar analysis on the local level. If we have enough resources, perhaps include gender in the analysis or compare our state and city data against national averages. Based on the quality of the data, include applicable statistical analyses to establish significance of gathered data.
